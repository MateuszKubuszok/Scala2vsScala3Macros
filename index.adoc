Every presentation should start with some excuse, why you even are here

== Agenda

[%step]
* What is a macro method?
* Expressions and types
* Symbols
* Examples showing similarities and differences when solving the same small problems
* I will focus on examples that I saw while maintaining my libraries
* I will NOT focus on macro annotations

[NOTE.speaker]
--
We will demonstrate these concepts using Scala CLI scripts.
--

== What is macro method?

We can intuitively think that macro method is a code generator pretending to be some object's method.

[NOTE.speaker]
--
We'll explain what we mean by that in the next few examples. We'll show how macros differ in behavior from normal method.
--

=== Let's see an example of a very simple macro

[%step]
1. Calling the impl method is the only thing we are allowed to do.
2. ``Expr[A]`` is the AST of code that represents the value of type ``A``.
3. Why Scala 2 call it blackbox will be explained later.
4. We can already notice one difference: Scala 3 has "global" expressions while Scala 2 use path-dependent types for them.

[NOTE.speaker]
--
We're start with the simplest code that returns a constant value (``01_simple_macro``).

I can mention that expression is basically anything that computes a value.
--

=== Can the AST generation be in a different place than macro method?

[%step]
1. Impl doesn't have to be in the same definition as unquoting - it doesn't even have to be in the same package!
2. Impl has to be defined in a preceeding compilation unit to call site (macro referring to it can be in the same as call site).

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Then we're going to look at the example above but with classes (``02_macro_with_classes``).

This is the first trope that we shouldn't treat macros as methods - they don't even have to be define in the same place as what unquotes them.
--

=== Let's call some method in the macro

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Now let's call some method in the same object as the macro (``03_calling_methods``).

We are ancouraged to use full qualified name in Scala 2 as it doesn't understand context in quasiquotes.

If we used private method, compilation would fail since external code cannot access private methods (``04_calling_private``).

This is a first

=== Let's try printing some parameters

[%step]
[cols="1,1",%autowidth]
|===
| Scala 2
| Scala 3

| ``(c: scala.reflect.macros.blackbox.Context)``
| ``(using quotes: scala.quoted.Quotes)``

| ``c.WeakTypeTag[A]`` (or ``c.TypeTag[A]``)
| ``scala.quoted.Type[A]``

| ``c.Type``
| ``quotes.reflect.TypeRepr``

| ``c.Expr[A]``
| ``scala.quoted.Expr[A]``

| ``c.universe.Tree``
| ``quotes.reflect.Tree``

| ``c.prefix``
| no counterpart

|===

[NOTE.speaker]
--
At first let's print some parameters to see how printing works (``05_print_param``).

Then let's try to print ``this`` (``06_print_this``).

Scala 2 require the same names and positions of parametrs in macro and in called impl definition.

Scala 2 require path-dependent type for WeakTypeTag as well, Scala 3 does not require it (like with Expr).

Typed representations exists to be passed around (as params/returns/implicits), untyped can be actually worked with.

Scala 2 contains a special value for what was before macro, and Scala 3 requires us to pass it explicitly.

[cols="1,1",%autowidth]
|===
| Scala 2
| Scala 3

| ``weakTypeOf[A]: c.Type``
| ``TypeRepr.of[A]: TypeRepr``

| ``c.WeakTypeTag[A](tpe: c.Type)``
| ``(tpe: TypeRepr).asType.asInstanceOf[Type[A]]``

| ``expr.tree``
| ``expr.asTerm``

| ``c.Expr[A](tree)``
| ``tree.asExprOf[A]``

|===

[NOTE.speaker]
--
``WeakTypeTag`` can only store proper types.

``quoted.Type`` has ``AnyKind`` so it can also store type constructor.

``asExprOf`` takes implicit ``Type``.

| Scala 2
| Scala 3

| ``show(expr)`` or ``showCode(expr)``
| ``expr.asTerm.show`` or ``expr.asTerm.show(using Printer.TreeCode)``

| no counterpart
| ``expr.asTerm.show(using Printer.TreeAnsiCode)``

| ``showRaw(expr)``
| ``expr.asTerm.show(using Printer.TreeStrucrture)``

| ``weakTypeOf[A].toString``

At first let's print some parameters to see how printing works (``05_print_param``).

Then let's try to print ``this`` (``06_print_this``).

Scala 2 always carries around what was "before" dot macro method name, Scala 3 requires explicit passing of this.

Scala 2 require path-dependent type for WeakTypeTag as well, Scala 3 does not require it (like with Expr).

Scala 2 require the same names and positions of parametrs in macro and in called impl definition.

Scala 2 contains a special value for what was before macro, and Scala 3 requires us to pass it explicitly.

Show example of ``07_reporting``.

Explain why ``println`` is not a good idea.

== Analyzing types

[%step]
Symbol - a reference to definition (type, class, val, var, method, parameter, binding...).

=== !

[%step]
[cols="1,1",%autowidth]
|===
| Scala 2
| Scala 3

| ``(tpe: c.Type).typeSymbol``
| ``(repr: TypeRepr).typeSymbol``

| ``sym.isType`` / ``sym.isClass`` / ``sym.isModule`` / ``sym.isTerm``
| ``sym.isType`` / ``sym.isClassDef`` / --- / ``sym.isTerm``

| ``sym.asType``, ``sym.asClass``, ``sym.asModule``, ``sym.asTerm``
| only 1 kind of ``Symbol``

| ``sym.asClass.primaryConstructor``
| ``sym.primaryConstructor``

| ``NoSymbol``
| ``Symbol.noSymbol``

| ``(tpe: c.Type).decls``
| ``sym.declaredFields`` / ``sym.declaredMethods``

| ``(tpe: c.Type).members``
| ``sym.fieldMembers`` / ``sym.methodMembers``

|===

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Let's try to see what information we can obtain from the type (``08_analyzing_type``).

1. Scala 3 has no ``isModule`` - we need to check that something has ``Flag.Modules``
2. Scala 2 name it ``isClass`` and Scala 3 ``isClassDef``
3. When class nas no constructor it has a special ``NoSymbol`` value
4. Scala 2 has ``members`` (all definitions, inherited or declared) and ``decls`` (only definitions defined in the type) in ``Type``, Scala 3 separated fields from methods and store them in ``Symbol``

I can explain that Symbol is basically anything which can have a name or handle to be referred to.

| ``List()``

| ``List(type A)``
| ``List()``
| ``List(List(type A))``

| ``def method[A](a: A): Unit``
| ``List(type A)``
| ``List(value a)``
| ``List(List(type A), List(val b))``

| ``extension [A](a: A) def method[b](b: B): Unit``
|
|
| ``List(List(type A), List(val a), List(type B), List(val b))``

[NOTE.speaker]

Mention SIP-47 Clause Interleaving.

== Building expressions

Example:

[%step]
* take a type of a ``case class``/``sealed trait``
* try to create ``List`` with a value of this type
  * for sealed, create all children that can be created
  * for case class create a value if all params has default value

=== !

== Skeletons in the closet

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Examples:

1. Scala 2's companion object issue
2. Scala 2's knownDirectChildren and incremental compiler
3. Scala 3's typeSignatureIn
4. Scala 3's public
5. Scala 3's fresh name

Also mention that:
1. default values in case class have different names (``apply`` vs ``<init>``)
2. parameterless ``case`` is not ``case object``
3. ``@BeanProperty`` difference

--

== Other differences

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Show whitebox macros and transparent inline defs.

Show macro bundles on Scala 2, and what Scala 3 has.
--

== Summary

[%step]
* basic concepts - typed and untyped expressions and types, AST, Symbols - are the same
* Scala 2 APIs have more utilities, Scala 3 had more consistent utilities
* both implementations have enough features to build upon them
* both implementations have rather basic documentation
* examples and slides available on my GitHub (GitHub.com/MateuszKubuszok)

== Questions?

== Thank You!
